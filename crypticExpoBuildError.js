This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app. The error message is not very specific, often mentioning issues with the Android build system or Gradle.  The actual cause can be subtle and hard to diagnose, such as an incompatibility between Expo modules or a conflict with a custom native module. It may manifest as a build failure that doesn't provide clear guidance on how to resolve the issue. For example, a cryptic error message might appear during the `expo build:android` command, halting the build process without clear indication of the source.
