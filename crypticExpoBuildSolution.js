The solution involves a systematic debugging approach.  First, carefully examine the complete Gradle build logs for more detailed error messages. Search for specific error codes or exceptions. Second, try to isolate the problem by creating a minimal, reproducible example.  If you are using custom native modules, temporarily remove them to see if the build succeeds. Similarly, try disabling Expo modules one by one to identify the conflicting module. If the problem persists, try cleaning the project using `expo prebuild --clean` and rebuilding.  Consider updating all Expo packages to their latest versions. If none of these steps work, consult Expo's community forums or create a support ticket with detailed information, including the complete error logs and your project setup.
